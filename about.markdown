Hi,  I’m **Jānis**. I’m an **indie app developer**. My main focus is iOS apps, but I make Mac and Android apps. I've been making apps since 2011.

What You'll Find Here:
- **iOS App Development Insights:** I'll cover iOS development from the basics to more advanced topics, all through the practical use of SwiftUI. Whether you're starting out or looking to improve your skills, I'll share useful insights and experiences.
- **Indie Development Story:** Join me as I share my journey as an indie developer. From developing and launching apps on my own to handling marketing, I'll talk about what works, what doesn't, and everything in-between.
- **SwiftUI Tips & Tricks:** Learn how to make your coding more efficient and your apps look better with regular advice on using SwiftUI. I aim to make these tips practical for everyday coding.
- **Mac & Productivity:** I'll also touch topics on how to use your Mac more effectively. 
- **Learning Together:** I believe we can all learn more by sharing and interacting. I'll write posts that encourage us to exchange ideas and grow our understanding of app development together.
